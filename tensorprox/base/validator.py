        Initiates and manages the main loop for the miner on the Bittensor network. The main loop handles graceful shutdown on keyboard interrupts and logs unforeseen errors.

        This function performs the following primary tasks:
        1. Check for registration on the Bittensor network.
        2. Continuously forwards queries to the miners on the network, rewarding their responses and updating the scores accordingly.
        3. Periodically resynchronizes with the chain; updating the metagraph with the latest network state and setting weights.

        The essence of the validator's operations is in the forward function, which is called every step. The forward function is responsible for querying the network and scoring the responses.

        Note:
            - The function leverages the global configurations set during the initialization of the miner.
            - The miner's axon serves as its interface to the Bittensor network, handling incoming and outgoing requests.

            KeyboardInterrupt: If the miner is stopped by a manual interruption.
            Exception: For unforeseen errors during the miner's operation, which are logged for diagnosis.
